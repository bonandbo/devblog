Inspired by my **current** boss and some other tech blogger, i see how easily they are to express their idea just by **an image**. Yes, instead of throwing out bunch of words, like what iam doing right now, just **draw**.
So i decided to join a classroom, thanks to my **current** boss again, share to me his course, then i attempted, and doing daily drawing for practicing

## Here the result after day 1

*PS I always think that I'm really bad at drawing until yesterday, since the teacher said:*
> You always said you don't know how to draw, but actually you do everyday
> Everytime you write an alphabet, you actually draw an arc and line and transform them to something which other people can understand
